several of the games in the python-games directory of Raspberry Pi require midi and a bug fix and are therefore not included in the launcher.

Midi can by installed by sudo apt-get install timidity

This repository contains the games that require timidity and also an unrelated bug fix for them to work properly.

It also contains a launcher.sh that has been extended to include the additional games.
